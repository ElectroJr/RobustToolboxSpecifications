# RobustToolboxSpecifications
A repository for specs for file/directory formats and other important parts of RobustToolbox.
## Submitting specs
Each specification set should go within it's own, appropriately titled folder. For example, the Robust Station Image spec would go in `RobustStationImage/{README.md, otherFilesHere}`
